To run the code for this project, follow these steps:
>Download the "Employee wages by occupation, annual" English Dataset (CSV file ) from the "Public Dataset Source" (the link is given in the above steps).
>Save the downloaded file to a folder, such as the "Project" folder.
>Unzip the downloaded file and ensure that it is saved in the same "Project" folder.
>Download and save the Jupyter notebook codes (5 research question codes in 5 separate ipynb files) in the same "Project" folder.
>Run each of the 5 ipynb files separately, one by one. Close the previous file before running the next one to avoid any potential clashes or warnings, as the CSV file contains around 1 GB data that will take some time to run in chunks initially. Please be patient while running these files.
>Once the processing is complete, the code will generate offline charts in HTML files that will be saved to the "Project" folder automatically. You can view these charts in your web browser, as the code will also redirect to the browser and display the relevant graph for the research question.
