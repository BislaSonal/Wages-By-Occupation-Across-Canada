#Public Dataset Source :  https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/

#Supporting document-Statistics Canada : https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/


#Tools and Liberaries Used: Python Language, Jupyter notebook,pandas and plotly

#Problem Statement :

1.The problem is the lack of clarity and transparency surrounding wages across different regions and industries in Canada. 

2.There are many sources of information on wages and salaries but these can be difficult to access and interpret, making it challenging for workers and employers alike to make informed decisions.

3.Additionally, understanding wage rates by age group and gender is important to assess pay equity.

#Research Questions :

1.What are the average wages across different occupations in Canada?

2.How do wages vary by province?

3.Which occupations offer the highest wages, and which offer the lowest?

4.How have wages across different occupations changed over time (Will take last 5 years only)?

5.Are there any significant gender pay gaps across different occupations in Canada?

#Learnings and Future Work :

1.Based on the size of the data, it is advisable to utilize Google Colab due to the availability of free GPU resources which can effectively enhance computation performance for large datasets

2.It is worth noting that the visualizations I presented may not be optimal, and thus there is a possibility of generating alternate charts while considering additional factors such as age groups , skill sets , other types of jobs like part time category and experience level etc.

3.In future investigations, it is recommended to consider the previously stated limitations and factors to facilitate the identification of further insights.
